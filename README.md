# FictionalMapGenDemo
This is a .NET 6.0 Windows Forms application which can be used for generating fictional maps of terrain with use of noise textures. Coming up with shapes that reasemble somewhat realistic map of continents and landmasses can be a difficult task. Using random noise to generate such shapes can yield satysfying results. This is a demo of a tool that can be used for that exact purpose.

[FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) is used for noise generation.
